                <br>
                <div>"Dream Weaver" is a song by the American singer Gary Wright, released as the first single from his third studio album The Dream Weaver in December 1975.</div>
                <br>
                <div>The track features Wright on vocals and keyboards and Jim Keltner on drums. According to Gary Wright, the song was inspired by Autobiography of a Yogi, which was given to him by George Harrison.[3] Paramhansa Yogananda's poem "God! God! God!" made reference to "the idea of the mind weaving dreams". The expression "Dream Weaver" was popularized by John Lennon in 1970 in his song "God", taken from his solo album John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band. This song depicts Lennon's declaration that he was the dream weaver of the 1960s, breaking away from the influences and dogmas that influenced his life.</div>
                <div>All instrumentation was created using keyboards except for Keltner's percussion. Gary Wright re-recorded "Dream Weaver" twice, first in 1986 (spelled "Dreamweaver" this time) for the Fire and Ice movie soundtrack, then in 1992 a longer version for the Wayne's World movie soundtrack.</div>
                <br>
                <div>In 1976, the song became a hit in the US; it peaked at #2 on the Billboard chart.It was kept from #1 by both "December, 1963 (Oh, What a Night)" by The Four Seasons and "Disco Lady" by Johnnie Taylor. "Dream Weaver" did get to #1 on Cashbox.</div>
